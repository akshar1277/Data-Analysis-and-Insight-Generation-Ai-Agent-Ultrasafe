# Statistical Assumptions

## Normality
- Data should be normally distributed for many parametric tests.
- Check with Q-Q plots or Shapiro-Wilk test.

## Homoscedasticity
- Variance should be equal across groups.
- Check with Levene's test or residual plots.

## Independence
- Observations should be independent.
- Check study design and data collection process.
