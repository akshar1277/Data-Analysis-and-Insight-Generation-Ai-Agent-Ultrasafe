## Statistical Test Selection Criteria

### Primary Decision Factors
- Research question type: comparison, relationship, or description
- Number of variables: univariate, bivariate, or multivariate
- Data type: categorical (nominal/ordinal) or continuous (interval/ratio)
- Sample size: large (n>30) or small (n<30)
- Data distribution: normal vs non-normal
- Study design: independent groups, paired/matched groups, or repeated measures

### Test Selection Framework
**For Comparing Groups:**
- Two independent groups, continuous data, normal distribution: Independent t-test
- Two independent groups, continuous data, non-normal: Mann-Whitney U test
- Two paired groups, continuous data, normal distribution: Paired t-test
- Two paired groups, continuous data, non-normal: Wilcoxon signed-rank test
- Multiple independent groups, continuous data, normal: One-way ANOVA
- Multiple independent groups, continuous data, non-normal: Kruskal-Wallis test
- Two categorical variables: Chi-square test of independence
- Small expected frequencies (<5): Fisher's exact test

**For Relationships:**
- Two continuous variables, linear relationship: Pearson correlation
- Two continuous variables, non-linear/non-normal: Spearman correlation
- Prediction with continuous outcome: Linear regression
- Prediction with binary outcome: Logistic regression
- Multiple predictors: Multiple regression

## Statistical Assumptions and Validation

### Common Statistical Assumptions
**Normality Assumption:**
- Required for: t-tests, ANOVA, linear regression, Pearson correlation
- Test methods: Shapiro-Wilk test (n<50), Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Q-Q plots
- Visual check: Histogram should show bell curve, Q-Q plot points should follow diagonal line
- Acceptance criteria: Shapiro-Wilk p>0.05, skewness within ±2, kurtosis within ±7

**Homogeneity of Variance:**
- Required for: Independent t-test, ANOVA
- Test method: Levene's test
- Acceptance criteria: p>0.05
